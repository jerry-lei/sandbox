make sure to link zmq:

ex: $ gcc app.cpp -o app -L/usr/local/lib -lzmq

Notes:

-- Strings aren't null-terminated!!

Can set context to a number of IO threads in the backgorund through
- zmq_ctx_set
--- Each IO thread equiv to individual socket (dozens -> thousands of connections at once)
--- if using zmq for internal message passing (through multithreading), IO threads can be set to 0

zmq_socket:
- context is thread safe
- multiple contexts may coexist within a single application

--- socket types: http://api.zeromq.org/3-2:zmq-socket


zmq_socket:
- not thread safe, cannot be used across multiple threads
